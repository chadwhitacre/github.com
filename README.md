Why can't we report GitHub issues using GitHub issues? Now we can! :D

The purpose of this repo is to track issues with GitHub products using GitHub issues. It's 
unofficial, though of course I would be only too happy to transfer ownership to GitHub. :-)

### New Plan

Go see https://github.com/isaacs/github instead (started a month earlier).

For posterity, a lively Twitter conversation is to be found here:
